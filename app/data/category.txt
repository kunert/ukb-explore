1	Population characteristics	0	1	This category contains data on some general characteristics of participants.	
2	Ongoing characteristics	0	1	This category contains data on some general characteristics of participants that were obtained or are updated on an ongoing basis following recruitment into UK Biobank.	
42	Algorithmically-defined outcomes	0	1	This category holds classification of selected health-related events, obtained through algorithmic combinations of coded information from UK Biobank's baseline assessment data collection (which included data from participants on their self-reported medical conditions, operations and medications), along with linked data from hospital admissions (diagnoses and procedures) and death registries. The classification is intended to help researchers to include health-related outcomes in their analyses without having to select lists of diagnostic and/or procedural codes and combine the different data sources themselves. It is based on algorithms developed by the UK Biobank outcome adjudication group, aiming to classify disease outcomes with high positive predictive value (i.e. a high probability that people classified as being positive for a health-related event have indeed experienced that event). Where possible, we provide the best available information on the estimated positive predictive value of each source or combination of sources so that researchers can use this information in their analyses.

54	MET Scores	0	1	This category contains derived MET (Metabolic Equivalent Task) scores data based on IPAQ (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) guidelines. Methods on how these fields were derived are described in the following OpenAccess publication that can be found in ~R3594~.	This data was generated as part of UKB Application ID 12184.<br>Principal Investigator: Mike Trenell, Newcastle University
76	Indices of Multiple Deprivation	0	1	Indices of Multiple Deprivation come from a UK government qualitative study of deprived areas in British local councils. The study is conducted separately in England (IMD), Scotland (SIMD) and Wales (WIMD). Scores were gathered from open data published by the UK government.	IMD scores offer a more complex and detailed view of deprivation, based on more factors than the Townsend index (~F189~). As IMD scores are calculated in different ways between England, Scotland and Wales, the UK Biobank team did not attempt to merge them and is publishing them separately. Scores were taken as close as possible to the baseline assessment, resulting in: <p> 8 scores for England, from the 2010 edition of English IMD <br> Original data: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/english-indices-of-deprivation <ul> <li>Index of Multiple Deprivation</li> <li>Crime score</li> <li>Education score</li> <li>Employment score</li> <li>Health score</li> <li>Housing score</li> <li>Income score</li> <li>Living environment score</li> </ul> <p> 8 scores for Scotland, from the 2009 edition of Scottish IMD <br> Original data: http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/SIMD <ul> <li>Index of Multiple Deprivation</li> <li>Access to services score</li> <li>Crime score</li> <li>Education score</li> <li>Employment score</li> <li>Health score</li> <li>Housing score</li> <li>Income score</li> </ul> <p> 9 scores for Wales, from the 2008 edition of Welsh IMD <br> Original data: http://gov.wales/statistics-and-research/welsh-index-multiple-deprivation/?lang=en <ul> <li>Index of Multiple Deprivation</li> <li>Access to services score</li> <li>Community safety score</li> <li>Education score</li> <li>Employment score</li> <li>Health score</li> <li>Housing score</li> <li>Income score</li> <li>Physical environment score</li> </ul>
100	Brain MRI	0	1	This category groups together results from the MRI brain imaging studies performed at UK Biobank assessment centres. <p>Before selecting this data it is strongly recommended that researchers view ~R1977~. <p> An email discussion list has been setup for researchers wishing todiscuss any aspects of the UK Biobank imaging protocols, data or analysis at ~Ehttps://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=UKB-NEUROIMAGING~.	The scanner used for data capture is a standard Siemens Skyra 3T running VD13A SP4 (as of October 2015), with a standard Siemens 32-channel RF receive head coil.

104	ECG at rest, 12-lead	0	1	12-lead ECG	
105	Abdominal MRI	0	1	Abdominal MRI scans	
106	Task functional brain MRI	0	1	Task functional MRI (tfMRI) uses the same measurement technique as resting-state fMRI (~L111~), while the subject performs a particular task or experiences a sensory stimulus. Derived phenotypic fields relate to the strength of response to the specific task (or a specific component of a more complex cognitive process) within a given anatomical brain region. The task used in Biobank was chosen to engage a range of high-level cognitive systems. <p> The task is the Hariri faces/shapes "emotion" task [Hariri et al., 2002, Barch et al., 2013], as implemented in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), but with shorter overall duration and hence fewer total stimulus block repeats. The participants are presented with blocks of trials and asked to decide either which of two faces presented on the bottom of the screen match the face at the top of the screen, or which of two shapes presented at the bottom of the screen match the shape at the top of the screen. The faces have either angry or fearful expressions. The ePrime script that controls the video presented to the participant is derived from the one used by the HCP, and is available under the Resources tab.	
107	Diffusion brain MRI	0	1	Diffusion-weighted imaging is a structural technique that measures the ability of water molecules to move within their local tissue environment. Water diffusion is measured along a range of orientations, providing two types of derived phenotype variables. Local (voxel-wise) estimates of diffusion properties reflect the integrity of microstructural tissue compartments (e.g., diffusion tensor estimates). Long-range estimates based on tract-tracing (tractography) reflect structural connectivity between pairs of brain regions.	
108	Scout images and configuration for brain MRI	0	1	Scout images for brain MRI	
109	Susceptibility weighted brain MRI	0	1	Susceptibility-weighted imaging is a structural technique that is sensitive to magnetized tissue constituents (magnetic susceptibility). Data from one scan (including phase and magnitude images from two echo times) can be processed in multiple ways to reflect venous vasculature, microbleeds or aspects of microstructure (e.g., iron, calcium and myelin).	
110	T1 structural brain MRI	0	1	T1-weighted imaging is a structural technique with high-resolution depiction of brain anatomy, having strong contrast between grey and white matter, reflecting differences in the interaction of water with surrounding tissues (tissue T1 relaxation times). This modality provides derived fields primarily relating to volumes of brain tissues and structures. It is also critical for calculations of cross-subject and cross-modality alignments, needed in order to process all other brain modalities.	
111	Resting functional brain MRI	0	1	Resting-state functional MRI (rfMRI) measures changes in blood oxygenation associated with intrinsic brain activity (i.e., in the absence of an explicit task or sensory stimulus). Derived phenotypic fields estimate the apparent connectivity between pairs of brain regions, as reflected in the presence of spontaneous co-fluctuations in signal (i.e., the appearance of a connection based on co-activity, as opposed to a structural tract from dMRI).	
112	T2-weighted brain MRI	0	1	T2-weighted imaging is a structural technique with contrast dominated by signal decay from interactions between water molecules (T2 relaxation times). Image intensity is primarily related to pathology, with relatively subtle signal differences between grey and white matter. T2-weighted images depict alterations to tissue compartments typically associated with pathology (e.g., white matter lesions). <p> After early piloting, a standard T2/PD-weighted acquisition was dropped due to a combination of factors such as overall value and timing practicalities.	This category primarily refers to the T2 FLAIR structural scan. <p> The T2/PD scan was originally tentatively included as a standard protocol in diagnostic imaging for the detection of some pathologies. Consultation with research experts concluded it has little or no value to the research questions UK Biobank is likely to investigate. Further, the b=0 dMRI scans can to some extent be used as a surrogate for this. Hence in the face of overall scan time pressure, the T2/PD scan was dropped from the protocol during the pilot.
113	Local environment	0	1	Properties of the local environment around participants.	
114	Residential air pollution	0	1	This category contains data on local environmental exposures, conducted by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (http://www.sahsu.org/) as part of the BioSHaRE-EU Environmental Determinants of Health Project (http://www.bioshare.eu/). The aim of the BioSHaRE-EU Environmental Determinants of Health Project is to harmonize environmental exposures from multiple biobanks in different countries. UK Biobank is a participating biobank in this project. <p> Air pollution estimates for the year 2010 were modelled for each address using a Land Use Regression (LUR) model developed as part of the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE, http://www.escapeproject.eu/), funded under the EU 7th Framework Programme (for references see below). The LUR model is based on ESCAPE monitoring done between 26 January 2010 - 18 January 2011, and air pollution estimates are representative for the year 2010. Traffic variables were calculated during the course of LUR based on Eurostreets (vs 3.1) digital road network for the year 2008. <p> Please note that the ESCAPE estimates for particulates are valid up to 400km from the monitoring area, which was in Greater London, but it is unclear how good the estimates are outside this area. All addresses which are more than 400km away from Greater London are not assigned PM10, PM2.5, PM2.5 absorbance and PM coarse concentrations and have missing data instead (number of records: 33,935). For more information on the individual models please see the ESCAPE project website: http://www.escapeproject.eu. <p> Air pollution estimates for the years 2005-2007 were derived from EU-wide air pollution maps (resolution 100 metre x 100 metre). The x,y-coordinates of UK Biobank participants were overlaid with these maps (projected to British National Grid) and the corresponding air pollution concentration of the 100 metre x 100 metre grid cell were assigned to the coordinate. EU-wide air pollution maps were modelled based on a LUR model for Europe which also includes satellite derived air pollution estimates to improve the model performance. For details of the model and model performance see: Vienneau D, de Hoogh K, Bechle MJ, Beelen R, van Donkelaar A, Martin RV, Millet DB, Hoek G, Marshall JD. 2013. Western European land use regression incorporating satellite- and ground-based measurements of NO2 and PM10. Environmental Science and Technology 47(23): 13555-13564.	
115	Residential noise pollution	0	1	This category contains data on local environmental exposures, conducted by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (http://www.sahsu.org/) as part of the BioSHaRE-EU Environmental Determinants of Health Project (http://www.bioshare.eu/). The aim of the BioSHaRE-EU Environmental Determinants of Health Project is to harmonize environmental exposures from multiple biobanks in different countries. UK Biobank is a participating Biobank in this project <p> Noise estimates for the year 2009 were modelled using a version of the CNOSSOS-EU noise model. These Common NOise aSSessment methOdS (CNOSSOS) are recommended by the European Noise Directive 2002/49/EC. <p> Noise pollution estimates for the year 2010 were modelled for each address using a Land Use Regression (LUR) model developed as part of the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) (http://www.escapeproject.eu/), funded under the EU 7th Framework Programme (for references see below). The LUR model is based on ESCAPE monitoring done between 26 January 2010 - 18 January 2011, and air pollution estimates are representative for the year 2010. Traffic variables were calculated during the course of LUR based on Eurostreets (vs 3.1) digital road network for the year 2008.	
116	Cognitive function online	0	1	Several of the cognitive function tests administered via touchscreen during the initial assessment visit were re-implemented as web-based questionnaires and participants were invited to complete them remotely. Two additional tests were also included. <p>The order of the tests was <ol> <li>Mood</li> <li>Fluid intelligence</li> <li>Trail making</li> <li>Symbol digit substitution</li> <li>Pairs matching</li> <li>Numeric memory</li> </ol> <p> A reaction time test was also performed however the results were felt to be of insufficient quality to present due to inconsistencies in the timing routines of the various browsers and devices used by participants to perform the test.	
117	Pairs matching	0	1	This category contains data on 'pairs' matching tests. Participants are asked to memorise the position of as many matching pairs of cards as possible. The cards are then turned face down on the screen and the participant is asked to touch as many pairs as possible in the fewest tries. <p> Either two or three rounds were conducted. The first round used 3 pairs of cards, the second 6 pairs of cards and the third 8 pairs of cards. Participants were only presented with the third round if they made 0 or 1 errors on the second round. <p> For non-specialists, the primary item of interest is likely to be ~F20132~. <p> This measure was also performed in clinics using a touchscreen in ~L100030~.	
118	Fluid intelligence	0	1	This category contains data on questions designed to assess 'Fluid intelligence' (i.e. the capacity to solve problems that require logic and reasoning ability, independent of acquired knowledge). The participant has 2 minutes to complete as many questions as possible from the test. <p> For non-specialists, the primary item of interest is ~F20191~. <p> This measure was also performed in clinics using a touchscreen in ~L100027~.	
120	Numeric memory	0	1	This category contains data on a test designed to assess numeric short-term memory, as part of the touchscreen questionnaire. The participant was shown a 2-digit number to remember. The number then disappeared and after a short while they were asked to enter the number onto the screen. The number became one digit longer each time they remembered correctly (up to a maximum of 12 digits). Data collected include the number of digits and value of the number, the length of time the number was displayed, the time that the participant first entered and last entered a digit, the time taken to complete the test, the value of the number entered by the participant, whether or not the participant was correct, the maximum number of digits remembered, and whether the test was completed. This test is available for a subset of participants. <p> This measure was also performed in clinics using a touchscreen in ~L100029~.	
121	Trail making	0	1	Participants were presented with a series of labelled circles and instructed to touch them according to a particular ordering rule. <p> Note that all results begin at the second item in each trail since the test is initiated by the participant correctly clicking on the first item at which point the timer is started. <p> This measure was also performed in clinics using a touchscreen in ~L505~.	
122	Symbol digit substitution	0	1	Participants were presented with a series of grids in which symbols were to be matched to numbers according to a key presented on the screen. <p> The values for ~F20198~, ~F20200~, ~F20229~ and ~F20230~ must be considered together as the corresponding entries in them relate to the same challenge/response pair. <p> This measure was also performed in clinics using a touchscreen in ~L502~.

129	Process completion times	0	1	Times when sections within the Assessment Centre were completed (i.e. signed-off by an appropriately qualified member of UK Biobank staff).	Note that (with the exception of Welcome and Consent) not all participants completed every stage and process. The absence of a record here indicates that the participant did not complete the corresponding stage/process.
130	Employment history	0	1	Participants were asked to enumerate their work history. Periods of 6 months or longer during which they were in paid full time employment for at least 15 hours each week have been labelled "jobs", with all other periods labelled "gaps". <p> Additional information about employment at the time of visiting a UK Biobank clinic is presented in ~L100064~.

150	Home locations	0	1	This section holds information on the geographical location of the home addresses of participants before, at and after recruitment. The co-ordinates presented were derived from UK postcode information obtained from a variety of sources including self-report by participants.	
151	Greenspace and coastal proximity	0	1	This category contains environmental indicators relating to greenspace exposure and distance to the coast that was attributed to participants based on home location grid references. The data linkage was undertaken by the European Centre for Environment and Human Health, University of Exeter Medical School. The available metrics include: <ul> <li>Greenspace estimates (at 1000m and 300m home location buffers);</li> <li>Land coverage estimates (for domestic gardens and water) (at 1000m and 300m home location buffers);</li> <li>Land coverage estimates for the 'natural environment' compared to the 'built environment' (at 1000m and 300m home location buffers);</li> <li>Distance from home location to the coast.</li> </ul> The location used for each measurement was the participant's home at the time they were assessed in a UK Biobank centre. The date of the assessment visit is indicated in ~F53~.	There is evidence to suggest that where one lives can influence mental and physical health. Application 15374 focussed on analysis of mental health, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity and physical activity. The aim was to understand the factors that mediate the relationship between the natural environment surrounding an individual and their physical and mental health. More specifically, the research sought to investigate associations between the environmental characteristics of participants' place of birth and current home location, and health outcomes (e.g. mental health and wellbeing, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and physical activity), with a focus on the questions: <ul> <li>Do individuals living in closer proximity to greenspace or blue space participate in more physical activity?</li> <li>Does proximity to greenspace or blue space influence mental health and wellbeing? Does physical activity mediate this?</li> <li>Are there associations between participants' place of birth and/or current living environment, and physical disease (specifically cardiovascular disease and diabetes)?</li> </ul> The Principal investigator was Dr Benedict Wheeler of the University of Exeter. <p> Note that some participants only have data available for one instance. The completeness of data across these fields is determined by the participant's country of residence since data-fields 24500-24505 are available for England only.
152	Process durations	0	1	To help UK Biobank optimise the use of equipment and staff time, many of the processes which occurred within the Assessment Centres were timed.	
153	Digestive health	0	1	Results of the on-line gastro-intestinal health self-assessment questionnaire issued in 2017.	
170	Exome sequences	0	1	The first tranche of UKBiobank whole exome sequencing (WES) is now available for ~50,000 UK Biobank participants. <p><b> To ensure equality of access the individual level data is currently embargoed to allow all researchers an opportunity to download the PLINK formatted data. The VCF files will be released by early-April followed by the CRAM files. Researchers who already have access to UK Biobank genetic data do NOT have to submit new baskets to request exome data - this will be done for them automatically by the Access team. </b> <p>This sample set prioritizes individuals with whole body MRI imaging data, enhanced baseline measurements, hospital episode statistics (HES), and/or linked primary care records. Additionally, one disease area was selected for enrichment: individuals with admission to hospital with a primary diagnosis of asthma (ICD10 J45 or J46). The sequenced set includes 194 parent-offspring pairs, 613 full-sibling pairs, including 26 trios, 1 monozygotic twin pair and 195 second degree genetically determined relationships. <p>Exomes were captured with the IDT xGen Exome Research Panel v1.0 including supplemental probes. The basic design targets 39Mbp of the human genome (19,396 genes). Multiplexed samples were sequenced with dual-indexed 75x75bp paired-end reads on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform using S2 flow cells. In each sample and among targeted bases, coverage exceeds 20X at 94.6% of sites on average. Complete sequencing protocols are described in detail by the summary manuscript (add link when available). This manuscript also fully describes the "SPB" primary and secondary analysis pipeline that converts raw sequencing data to a quality-controlled set of population variation. The SPB pipeline first converted all raw sequencing data to FASTQs according to Illumina NovaSeq best practices and aligned those reads to the GRCh38 reference genome with BWA-mem to generate a CRAM file for each sample. After read-duplicate marking, SNVs and indels were called for with WeCall (GenomicsPLC), generating a gVCF per sample. These gVCFs were joint genotyped using GLnexus (~Ehttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/572347v1~) to create a single, unfiltered project-level VCF (pVCF). Genotype depth filters (SNV DP&gt;7, indel DP&gt;10) were applied prior to variant site filters requiring at least one variant genotype passing an allele balance filter (heterozygous SNV AB&gt;0.15, heterozygous indel&lt;0.20), resulting in a second 'filtered' pVCF. A total of 4,735,722 variants are identified within targeted regions, with 9,693,536 variants identified across all covered bases including 100bp regions flanking the capture targets. <p>To maximize data utility and ease of use, an additional "Functionally Equivalent" (FE) pVCF was generated from FASTQs, following the primary analysis protocol described in the 2018 manuscript (PMID: 30279509) and then subject to GATK 3.0 variant calling and hard filtering of variants with inbreeding coefficient&lt;-0.03 or without at least one variant genotype of DP&ge;10, GQ&ge;20 and, if heterozygous, AB&ge;0.20.

263	Genotypes	0	1	Genome-wide genetic data is available for 488,000 UK Biobank participants. <p> Genotype calling was performed by Affymetrix (now part of ThermoFisher Scientific) on two closely related purpose-designed arrays. ~50,000 participants were run on the UK BiLEVE Axiom array (~R149600~) and the remaining ~450,000 were run on the UK Biobank Axiom array (~R149601~). The dataset combines results from both arrays (see ~F22000~) and there are 805,426 markers in the released genotype data. The positions of markers in the data are in GRCh37 coordinates. It was not possible to assay genotypes for some participants (~3%) as sufficient DNA could not be extracted from their blood samples. <p> The genotype data were quality controlled (QC). In addition the dataset was phased and ~96M genotypes were imputed using computationally efficient methods combined with the Haplotype Reference Consortium and UK10K haplotype resources. Classical allelic variations at eleven HLA genes were imputed. Information from the QC pipeline, such as array, and important genetic properties of the data such as population structure and relatedness are available. <p>Details of these analyses, and the methods used to derive other data such as imputation and haplotypes, is given in: <br> Bycroft et al, "The UK Biobank resource with deep phenotyping and genomic data", <a class="basic" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0579-z">Nature,562, pp 203-209 (2018)</a>, which Researchers using this data are asked to cite (~R530~). <p> The types of genetic data available are <ul> <li>Genotypes</li> <li>SNP and Sample QC information</li> <li>Imputed Genotypes</li> <li>Phased haplotypes</li> <li>Imputed classical HLA types</li> <li>Genotype intensities</li> <li>Genotype confidences</li> <li>Genotype SNP-posteriors</li> <li>Genotype B-allele-frequency and Log2Ratio</li> <li>Array definition files</li> </ul> <p> <i> <b>There was a problem with Version 2 of the Imputed Genotypes data - please ensure you are using Version 3.

2000	Hospital in-patient	0	1	This category contains data on in-patient hospital admissions, obtained through linkage to external data providers. In-patients are defined as persons who are admitted to hospital and occupy a hospital bed. This includes both admissions where an overnight stay is planned and day cases. <p>A <i>Spell</i> is a total continuous stay of a patient in a hospital from admission to discharge. A Spell is split into one or more <i>Episodes</i>, each of which is a continuous period of care administered under one consultant within that hospital provider. If a patient is transferred to another consultant during a Spell, a new Episode is generated. Each record in the in-patient hospital data corresponds to a single Episode, with particular fields indicating which Spell it belongs to and its position within that Spell. <p>Hospital in-patient data are available to researchers in two formats: <p> <b>Spell and Episode Data</b> <br>If you select data-fields from the <i>Spell & Episode Data</i> sub-categories in your basket, then due to the size and complexity of the data, access to the specific fields you have selected will be made available via the HES Data Portal. <p>The Episode-level data has not been subjected to any substantial processing by UK Biobank, and is provided in a form close to the form in which we received it. For researchers needing only data about diagnoses and procedures and their first known occurence dates we would recommend using the Summary Information fields below. <p> <b>Summary Information</b> <br>The Summary Information sub-categories provide a simplified overview of the data appearing in the Episode-level in-patient data. These data-fields include a list for each participant of all the distinct values that appear for that data-field across all episodes in the in-patient data. For most of the diagnosis and operation summary data-fields only there are accompanying data-fields containing the date each diagnosis or procedure code was first recorded in the inpatient data for each participant. <p>If you select data-fields from the Summary Information sub-categories in your basket they will appear in a standard UK Biobank dataset.	This data is large and complex and we advise you to read the explanatory documentation provided in the Additional Resources tab for details on how these data are presented and made accessible. The <a class="basic" href="/crystal/exinfo.cgi">Essential Information</a> section presents summaries regarding the extent of data that is currently available, in the form of tabulations of the number of participants with one or more admissions for selected incident outcomes, and direct links to these are given below: <p> <ul> <li><a class="basic" href="/crystal/exinfo.cgi?src=ICD_xtab_by_diag">Position of diagnosis code</a></li> <li><a class="basic" href="/crystal/exinfo.cgi?src=ICD_xtab_by_year_rec">Year of recruitment</a></li> <li><a class="basic" href="/crystal/exinfo.cgi?src=ICD_xtab_by_sex">Sex</a></li> <li><a class="basic" href="/crystal/exinfo.cgi?src=ICD_xtab_by_age">Age at diagnosis</a></li> <li><a class="basic" href="/crystal/exinfo.cgi?src=ICD_xtab_by_year_diag">Year of diagnosis</a></li> <li><a class="basic" href="/crystal/exinfo.cgi?src=ICD_xtab_by_ethnic">Ethnic group</a></li> </ul> <p> This data does not take into account information from participant self-report or other linked sources of data such as hospital outpatient records or primary care data. As such, outcomes not resulting in hospital admission are not captured by these data. Both because of this, and because UK Biobank participants are not representative of the general UK population, these numbers should not be regarded as estimates of disease rates in the UK population. <p> The conditions highlighted here are chosen based on their likely research interest and impact on public health and/or because they are the most common. In-patient data on cancer outcomes are not listed here because more complete data on cancer registrations is provided from linkage to cancer registry data (~L100092~). <p>The accuracy of the codes has not been checked in detail and UK Biobank's Outcomes Working group is currently working to adjudicate the most common outcomes. Please see ~L42~ for further details of these. <p> Information about the temporal coverage of the in-patient data from each data provider, along with suggested censoring dates can be found at: http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/exinfo.cgi?src=Data_providers_and_dates

100004	Procedural metrics	0	1	This category contains information related to the Assessment Centre systems and procedures.	
100005	Pilot assessment	0	99	The first Assessment Centre opened by UK Biobank (Cheadle, 2006) is known as the Pilot centre. The results from it were used to refine the design of the questionnaires and measurement techniques for the subsequent centres. As a consequence of this refinement process some of the questions and tests used in the Pilot were superceded and do not appear in the results from the later centres. Approximately 3600 people attended the Pilot centre.	
100006	Physical measures	0	1	This category contains information from physical measurements done at the Assessment Centre and is divided into sub-categories based on the type of physical measure performed.	
100007	Arterial stiffness	0	1	This category contains data on arterial stiffness (vascular reactivity) using the pulse waveform obtained at the finger with an infra-red sensor (PulseTrace PCA2, CareFusion, USA). The shape of the volume waveform in the finger is directly related to the time it takes for the pulse waves to travel through the arterial tree in the lower body, and to be reflected back to the finger. The time between peaks of the waveform (the peak-to-peak time; PPT) is divided into the person's height to obtain the Stiffness Index (SI). Blood pressure was also recorded. Measurement is made by clipping the device to a finger; the reading is made over 10-15 seconds. These measures were introduced to the Assessment Centre towards the end of recruitment.	
100008	Anthropometry	0	1	This category contains information on the type of body composition measures that were performed, including manual body measures (i.e. waist and hip circumference, height), and whole-body bioimpedance measures (giving segmental estimates of fat percentage, fat mass, fat-free mass and predicted muscle mass).	
100009	Impedance measures	0	1	This category contains data on whole-body bio-impedance measures using the Tanita BC418MA body composition analyser (i.e. basal metabolic rate, body type, weight, body fat mass, body fat percentage, fat free mass, water mass, predicted muscle mass and impedance for the right arm, right leg, left arm, left leg and trunk).	
100010	Body size measures	0	1	This category contains data on body composition measures that were taken manually (i.e. standing/sitting height, waist/hip circumference, weight, body mass index, reason for skipping these measurements, if applicable).	
100011	Blood pressure	0	1	This category contains information on blood pressure measurements and pulse rate using the Omron Digital blood pressure monitor. Two blood pressure measurements were performed on each individual, using automated (the default option) or manual devices.	
100012	ECG during exercise	0	1	This category contains data on cardio-respiratory fitness, and involves heart-rate monitoring (using a 4-lead electrocardiograph [ECG]; CAM-USB 6.5, Cardiosoft v6.51) during cycle ergometry on a stationary bike (eBike, Firmware v1.7) with a ramp slope that is adapted to the individual based on age, gender, weight and medical history. ECGs were recorded pre-test (15 seconds), during activity (6 minutes) and in recovery (1 minute). The participant's risk category was first calculated to determine what level of activity they should perform or have only a resting ECG performed. The percentage levels of effort during activity were then determined according to their risk category, and their maximum workload was calculated according to age, height, weight, resting heart rate and sex. These measures were introduced to the Assessment Centre towards the end of recruitment. <p> Please note that the ecg/fitness data fields have not yet been summarised into a form suitable for non-specialists and require expert knowledge for analysis. Derived summary variables will be incorporated into the resource when this work is complete.	
100013	Eye measures	0	1	This category contains data on whether both eyes are present and whether they are any contra-indications for the eye measurements, along with a range of measures of eye function, subdivided into categories of: visual acuity, refractive error, intraocular pressure/corneal biomechanics, and optical coherence tomography. These measures were introduced to the Assessment Centre towards the end of recruitment.

Because data is continually accruing, please be aware that the follow-up time and number of cases presented in the Health Outcomes report may vary from the data sent out to researchers. <p> While we have attempted to provide meanings for all codes supplied here, there has been no detailed data cleaning. For example, there are a small number of participants with apparent duplicate data (i.e. diagnosed with the same cancer type on the same date, or shortly thereafter) and we have made no attempt to remove these (or any other oddities from the data). The Cancer Outcomes Working Group is preparing a more refined dataset for cancer outcomes, which will be available in due course.

100115	UK Biobank Urban Morphometric Platform	0	1	<p>This category contains data obtained from a morphometric analysis of the built environment that was conducted by the Cochrane Institute of Primary Care and Public Health, Cardiff University. The aim of this project was to create an objective assessment of the built environment within the immediate residential neighbourhood of UK Biobank participants. Since January 2017, Built Environment metrics are available for participants from all assessment centres. <p>The available metrics include: <ul> <li>Building class</li> <li>Destination accessibility</li> <li>Greenness</li> <li>Land use density</li> <li>Street network accessibility</li> <li>Terrain (slope)</li> <li>Accessibility foodscapes (London area only)</li> </ul>	The aim of the UK Biobank Built Environment project was the objective assessment of the built environment (OABE) around the immediate neighbourhood of 500,000 participants of the UK Biobank cohort. <p>This resulted in the modelling, compilation and linkage of corresponding longitudinal spatial database of built environment with the UK Biobank health datasets. The large-scale automation of such detailed and precise measures of individual-level built environment morphological metrics (morphometrics) has the potential to unravel the black box of causality, the pathways through which built environment in conjunction with the social and natural environment act as one of fundamental determinants of individual behaviour, physical and mental health. <p>OABE of UK Biobank can thus produce a comprehensive evidence-base on the impact of BE on lifestyle, behaviour and thereby health and hence, guide preventive intervention strategies as well as policy formulation.
100120	Communication and participation in extension studies	0	99	Following recruitment participants are being invited to take part in a range of extension studies. This category groups together the fields indicating which participants were invited to particular studies and whether they were able to take part.	
100313	Genotyping process and sample QC	0	1	Information from the genotype calling and sample quality control pipeline, such as relatedness and population structure (PCA), which may be important for downstream analyses. Category also includes experimental factors from the Affymetrix genotype calling pipeline. <p> These fields are a subset of the sample quality control information available in the sample_qc file (which can be downloaded from the EGA). Descriptions of all the Sample-QC fields are in ~R531~. <p>Information on estimated relatedness can be obtained using the ukbgene utility - see ~R664~.	
100314	Genomics	0	1	The UK Biobank resource currently contains the following genomic data: <ul> <li>Genotypes and imputation therefrom for 488,000 participants;</li> <li>Exome sequences for 50,000 participants;</li> <li>Whole genome sequences for 50 participants.</li> </ul> <p> Questions about using the genomic information can be directed to a special UK Biobank mailing list, which can be joined at ~Ehttps://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=UKB-GENETICS~.	It is anticipated that exome sequencing data will be made available for an additional 100,000 participants at the end of 2019 and for the whole cohort at the end of 2020.
100315	Genotype Results	0	1	Genotype calls (based on genotyping array measurements) and related measurements. The genotypes are aligned to the + strand of the reference and positions are in GRCh37 coordinates. <p> The fields listed here are indicators and adding them to an Application basket will allow researchers to download the corresponding underlying information from the UKB repository. This information includes <ul> <li>Calls (0.1TB)</li> <li>Confidences (2.9TB)</li> <li>Intensities (2.9TB)</li> <li>CNV B-allele frequencies (1.5TB)</li> <li>CNV log2ratios (2.3TB)</li> </ul> <p> Marker quality control (QC) and Sample QC information, including population structure (see Relatedness in the Notes below) is also available. Intensity and SNP posteriors are available for cluster plotting. B-allele frequency and log2ratio are available for CNV analysis. <p>The lists of SNPs in the Genotype datasets can be downloaded from the Field's Resources tabs on a per-chromosome basis or as a combined tar in ~R1963~. <p> Researchers who need only a few specific genotyped SNPs (rather than the whole-chromosome datasets below) should list these SNP IDs on the "free-text" option section of their Application and a custom dataset will be created for them (please state whether the loci are listed as rsID or Affymetrix ID values.) <p> See ~R530~ for additional information, including a citable reference for publications.	The genotype <b>Calls</b> are in binary PLINK format (.bed, .bim, .fam) see https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats for details of the formats. The BIM file determines the order of markers in the calls and all of the other genotype data sets. The SNP_id is the rsid where it is available or the Affymetrix_SNP_id otherwise. The positions are in GRCh37 coordinates. The FAM file determines the order of samples in the calls and all of the other genotype data sets. The FAM file includes 'Batch' in the Phenotype field (6th column). <p> The <b>Confidence</b> files contain the Affymetrix 'confidence' that a genotype belongs to the call cluster. This is a plaintext file with space separated columns. Values are in the range 0-1 with 0 being most confident. Missing values are represented by -1. The order of markers and Samples are given by the BIM and FAM files. <p> The <b>CNV</b> files contain the B-Allele-Frequency (baf) and Log2Ratio (log2r) transformed intensity values for performing CNV calling. There is a separate file for baf and log2r per chromosome. These are plaintext files with space separated columns. The rows correspond to markers (ordered as the calls BIM file) and the columns correspond to samples (ordered as the calls FAM file) Missing values are represented by -1. <p> The <b>Intensity</b> files contains the A,B intensity data measured by Affymetrix. The files are in a simple custom binary format. There are two intensity values A,B for each genotype, each represented as a 4-byte float. The set of A,B values for each marker are ordered consecutively by sample (analagous to a matrix with rows=SNPs and columns=Samples) e.g. SNP_1_SAMPLE_1_A SNP_1_SAMPLE_1_B SNP_1_SAMPLE_2_A SNP_1_SAMPLE_2_B ... SNP_1_SAMPLE_N_A SNP_1_SAMPLE_N_B SNP_2_SAMPLE_1_A SNP_2_SAMPLE_1_B ... Missing pairs of intensities are represented by -1 -1. The order of the markers and Samples are given by the BIM and FAM files with the calls. <br> Affymetrix transform the A,B values into 'contrast' and 'strength' for their calling algorithm. If the intensity data is to be used for making cluster plots it is strongly suggested that the transformed values are plotted. The ellipses described by the snp-posterior data are only compatible with the transformed intensity values. <ul> <li>contrast (X) = log2(A/B)</li> <li>strength (Y) = log2(AB)/2</li> </ul> Affymetrix called the genotypes in (106) batches of ~4,700 samples. To accurately examine the cluster plots, each batch should be plotted separately for a given marker. For chrX, males and females were called separately, so males and females should be plotted separately for chrX markers. Evoker (https://github.com/wtsi-medical-genomics/evoker) can be used to plot cluster plots, following the recommendations above, for the UK Biobank data. <p> The <b>Relatedness</b> of individuals is obtained using the ukbgene utility (~R664~) which generates a plaintext file with 5 space-separated columns: <ol> <li>ID for participant 1 in related pair;</li> <li>ID for participant 2 in related pair;</li> <li>HetHet : fraction of markers for which the pair both have a heterozygous genotype;</li> <li>IBS0 : fraction of markers for which the pair shares zero alleles;</li> <li>Estimate of the kinship coefficient for this pair based on the set of markers used in the kinship inference;</li> </ol> where the HetHet, IBS0 and Kinship values were generated by the KING software.
100316	Genotype confidences	0	1	Genotype probabilities associated with genotyping array measurement calls. <p> The UKB download format uses 2-bytes to store each person/snp Confidence value. <p>NOTE: the fields here relate to the Initial 150K person release and are now obselete. They may no longer be added to Application baskets.	The Confidence value stored is the estimated probability that a given Call is incorrect, hence a value of 0.1 means that the Call is believed to have a 90% probability of being accurate. Confidences above 0.15 (i.e. below 85% certainty) were regarded as indicating unreliable results and the corresponding Calls marked as unknown/indeterminate.
100317	Genotyping intensities	0	1	Genotyping intensities used in genotyping array measurements. <p> The UKB download format uses 8-bytes to store each person/snp Intensity value. <p>NOTE: the fields here relate to the Initial 150K person release and are now obselete. They may no longer be added to Application baskets.	
100319	Imputation	0	1	Imputed genotype and phased haplotype values. Genotypes were imputed into the dataset using computationally efficient methods combined with the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) and UK10K haplotype resource. This increased the number of testable variants over 100-fold to ~96 million variants, which are stored in the compressed and indexed BGENv1.2 format. The imputed genotypes are aligned to the + strand of the reference and the positions are in GRCh37 coordinates. <p> The fields listed here are indicators and adding them to an Application basket will allow researchers to download the corresponding underlying information from the UKB repository. This information includes <ul> <li>Imputation (2.6TB)</li> <li>Haplotypes (0.06TB)</li> </ul> <p> The lists of SNPs in the imputed datasets can be downloaded from the Field's Resources tabs on a per-chromosome basis or as a combined tars in ~R1965~ and ~R1671~. The information scores and minor allele frequency data for the imputed genotypes (computed with QCTOOL) can also be downloaded in ~R1967~. <p>Questions about using the imputed genotypes can be directed to a special UK Biobank mailing list, which can be joined at ~Ehttps://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=UKB-GENETICS~. <p> See ~R530~ for additional information (such as the quality control) including a citable reference for publications. <p> <b> Please note: there was a problem with version 2 of the UK Biobank imputed data. Please ensure you are using version 3 of the imputed data.</b> Version 2 of the non-imputed data continues to be correct and current. <p>The problem with version 2 of the imputed data was as follows: <i> <p> The genetic data was imputed using two different reference panels. The Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) panel was used wherever possible, but for SNPs not in that reference panel the UK10K + 1000 Genomes panel was used. The problem arose in the second set of imputed data from the UK10K + 1000 Genomes panel. The genotypes at these SNPs were imputed correctly, but they were not recorded as having the correct genome position in the files. <p> The imputed data from the HRC panel was not affected and had the correct positions. This was about ~40M sites and included the majority of the common SNPs i.e. sites most likely to show genetic associations. These sites could be identified using the publicly available HRC site list at ~Ehttp://www.haplotype-reference-consortium.org/site~. </i>	The <b>Imputed</b> genotype calls are in BGEN v1.2 format (.bgen, .sample, .bgi) see ~R12~ for details of the formats. The sample file lists the order of the samples in the .bgen files. The list of variants in the files can be found with bgenix (https://bitbucket.org/gavinband/bgen/wiki/bgenix). The 1st column of the marker list file is 'alternate_ids' which is a unique identifier for each marker. For markers in the genotype data set 'alternate_ids' is the genotype marker id (rs_id in SNP-QC file). The second column is rsid or the reference panel marker_id, it is not guaranteed to be unique. The alleles in the imputation are aligned with REF/ALT, first_allele is the ref allele on the fwd strand. <p> <p> The phased <b>Haplotypes</b> are in BGEN v1.2 format (.bgen, .sample, .bgi) see ~R12~ for details of the formats. The sample file lists the order of the samples in the .bgen files.
199001	Interim genotype release	0	1	This category groups together data fields which were relevant to the initial genotype data release (150K people) but became obselete when the main genotyping results (488K people) were released in 2017. The fields here are presented for reference only and may not be selected for download. The various Resource materials should be regarded as obselete as, generally, they were superceded or invalidated when the main genotyping results were release.
